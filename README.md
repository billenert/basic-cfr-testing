## unique number game
imagine the following 3-player game: 3 players select a random integer from 1 to A, and the player with the lowest unique number wins. if no one has a unique number, no one wins. what's the optimal strategy for each player?

obviously you can solve this much more precisely mathematically, but this was a good/easy starting point for me to implement cfr.

i implemented the cfr here faithfully to this paper: https://poker.cs.ualberta.ca/publications/NIPS07-cfr.pdf.
